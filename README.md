# Thing

Thing is a fines management app inspired by Norse mythology, designed to facilitate the registration and management of fines within groups.

## What is Thing?

Thing takes its name from the ancient Norse assemblies where matters of importance were discussed and resolved. In the same spirit, Thing serves as a modern platform for groups to handle fines and penalties collectively.
